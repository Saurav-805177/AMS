                                 Instead, transactions are verified and added to the blockchain by a network of nodes, each of which has a copy of the ledger. This makes the blockchain more secure and resistant to hacking, as there is no single point of failure.
                                 The blockchain is a chain of blocks, each containing a record of multiple transactions. Each block contains a unique cryptographic hash, which links it to the previous block in the chain, creating a secure and immutable record of all transactions.

                                The design of robots can vary greatly depending on their intended use. Industrial robots, for example, are often large, heavy-duty machines that are used in manufacturing and production lines to perform repetitive tasks such as welding, painting, or assembly. Mobile robots, on the other hand, are designed to move around and navigate autonomously, such as drones or robots used for search and rescue operations.
                                Robots can be controlled in a number of ways, including by remote control, pre-programming, or through sensors that allow them to perceive their environment and adapt their behavior accordingly.
